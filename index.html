            <span class="font-bold text-2xl">Why it matters?</span> <br />
            A flourishing life on land is the foundation for our life on this planet.We are all part of the planet’s
            ecosystem and we have caused severe damage to it through deforestation, loss of natural
            habitats and land degradation. Promoting a sustainable use of our ecosystems and preserving
            biodiversity is not a cause. It is the key to our own survival.
            Biodiversity is essential for all life on Earth, including human life. Forests cover around 30%
            of the Earth’s land area, containing 80% of terrestrial biomass and providing habitat for with
            rice, maize and wheat providing 60% of energy intake. In addition, 80% of people living in rural
            areas in developing countries rely on traditional plant-based medicines to provide their basic
            healthcare.The biodiversity of inland water, addressed as well by SDG 15, sustains ecosystems
            and ecosystem services that are key for human well-being, as well as for many life stages of
            aquatic and migratory species.
            Business and ecosystems are linked. Companies affect ecosystems because they rely on
            the provisioning services (e.g. freshwater, fiber, food) and regulatory services (e.g. climate
            regulation, flood control, water purification) ecosystems provide.
            60% of the world’s ecosystem services have been degraded over the past 50 years and we
            continue devaluing our natural resources at an alarming rate. Estimates indicate that 2-5
            trillion USD of ecosystem services are lost each year from deforestation alone. While many of
            the effects are felt locally first, the long-term consequences are global and the scale is highly
            relevant to business, presenting risks and opportunities.
            To retain the integrity and vitality of natural resources today and for future generations and
            to ensure long-term socio-economic growth and prosperity, sustainable management of land
            is key. Business can directly contribute to this SDG by measuring, managing and mitigating
            its impact and dependence on land and ecosystems. Companies can implement strategies
            to incentivize sustainable land use, responsible forest management and environmental
            stewardship. To secure supply of natural resources and raw material in the future, companies
            will also have to increase efforts to restore degraded land. By scaling up research and
            development in innovation, investing in natural infrastructure and implementing responsible
            sourcing policies, companies play an integral part in preserving and restoring vital ecosystems,
            promoting the sustainable use of land and forests, while retaining consumer confidence in their
            product offerings.
            From deforestation to urbanisation to industrialisation to agriculture and global warming, land
            pollution has seen an ever-increasing curve in the last 50 years. The percentage of barren land
            in the world in increasing exponentially causing serious concern for scientists across the world
            about the grim future for mankind. Without fertile land, we can’t produce food. The poisoning of
            land will lead to the poisoning of the food chain. One one hand there would be food shortages
            while on the other hand, the population is doubling every year in many countries. Given such
            a tricky situation, scientists have predicted that there would be no food to feed our growing
            population in the next 50 years. The third world war will be fought for fertile land and food.
            <br /> <span class="font-bold text-2xl pt-20"> How can we address this?</span> <br />

            Preserving life on land requires concerted action not only to protect terrestrial ecosystems, but
            to restore them, and promote their sustainable use for the future. Goal 15 calls for urgent action
            to halt the degradation of natural habitats, to end the poaching and trafficking of animals, and
            to integrate ecosystem and biodiversity values into local planning and development processes.
            Safegaurding places which are important from the point of view of biodiversity is another
            effective tool, and as of 2014, 15.2% of the earth’s terrestrial and freshwater environments had
            been protected.
            Use of non-biodegradable items will reduce land pollution.
            Proper laws and regulations should be formulated to prevent land pollution.
            But not everything will be downhill if we take proper care and precautions now. All countries
            need to come together and formulate international laws on how to use land judiciously. A break
            should be put on rapid urbanisation, garbage disposal mechanisms and industrialisation in
            developing countries. The carbon footprint by developed countries should also be reduced.
            Our planet is in great danger if we don't do something about it. In some cases, I have found
            various environmentalists questioning questioning their efforts. However, it is still important
            that we don’t quit. If only every one in every home would decide to do their part and help to keep
            our air clean, our water unpolluted and our wild life safe. The Earth is our home and we need to
            protect it. There is no PLANET B.
